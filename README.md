# PM Weather

**PM Weather** is a lightweight desktop application that pulls and displays weather information from Openweather API.</br>
It has robust location detection using openweather geocoding API ensuring only valid cities are accepted.</br>
It's serverless and stores user data locally using SQLite.</br>
Built with **React + Vite** and wrapped in **Electron**, it runs as a native Windows app without installation required (portable).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Method 1 â€” Grab the latest release (easiest)

1. Download the newest ZIP from the **[Releases](../../releases)** tab on GitHub.
2. Unzip it anywhere you like.
3. Open the `PM_Weather` folder and double-click **`PM_Weather.exe`**.
   Done.

### Method 2 â€” Build from source (assuming VS Code workflow)

| Step | What to do |
|------|------------|
| 1 | **Install Node.js** (tested with node v22.14.0 and npm v11.3.0). |
| 2 | Open the project folder in **VS Code** (or whatever editor you prefer). |
| 3 | In the terminal, run `npm install` to install all dependencies. |
| 4a | Either `npm run dbuild` &nbsp;â†’ builds _and_ launches the desktop app. |
| 4b | Or `npm run dist` &nbsp;â†’ creates a production build plus both an installer and portable `.exe`. Then go in the application project folder, and in the release folder, you can either use the installer (`PM_Weather Setup 1.0.0.exe`) or the portable version (inside the `win-unpacked` folder, double-click on `PM_Weather.exe`). |
